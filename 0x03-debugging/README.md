## Project Description
- Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in software that prevents it from running correctly. As you become a more advanced programmer and an industry engineer, you will learn how to use debugging tools such as `gdb` or built-in tools that IDEs have. However, itâ€™s important to understand the concepts and processes of debugging manually.
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All your files should end with a new line
- Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
- A README.md file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project (i.e. `0x03-debugging`), describing what this project is about
